# Fresh Plugins

This directory contains **Fresh editor plugins** and plugin-related resources.

Fresh plugins are written in **TypeScript** and run in a **sandboxed Deno environment**.  
They extend Fresh with commands, UI helpers, editor behavior, and integrations.

This folder contains:
- example plugins
- reference implementations
- links to external plugin repositories

---

## What belongs here

- Small, focused plugins
- Example implementations demonstrating best practices
- Utilities that don’t belong in core Fresh (yet)

If a plugin grows large or becomes independently useful, it may live in its own repo and be linked here instead.
