# Fresh Keymap Presets

This directory contains **ready-to-use keymap presets** for the Fresh editor.

These keymaps are meant to:
- be dropped in and used immediately
- reflect real editing styles
- reduce friction when switching editors

They are opinionated by design.

## How to use a keymap

1. Copy the keymap file you want:
   ```sh
   cp keymaps/vim-like.json ~/.config/fresh/keymap.json
