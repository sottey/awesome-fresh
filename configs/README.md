# Fresh Config Presets

This directory contains **opinionated Fresh editor configuration presets**.

These are meant to be:
- copy-pasteable
- easy to understand
- focused on specific workflows

They are **not** meant to replace the official Fresh docs, but to provide *practical starting points*.

## How to use these configs

1. Copy the config you want:
   ```sh
   cp configs/minimal.json ~/.config/fresh/config.json
